- Features
    - Computation Planning: Define and manage computational plans with a specified root path and persistence mechanism.
    - Dynamic Chat Completion: Utilize OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo to generate chat completions based on structured input.
    - JSON Persistence: Store and retrieve the state of the computation in a JSON format.
    - Modular Design: Extensible architecture with clear separation of concerns among different modules such as planning, state management, and JSON persistence.
    - CLI Tool: A command-line interface for interacting with the computation engine and executing plans.
    - Constitution-based Processing: Define a constitution to guide the computation process, with the ability to retrieve system and input data for constitution-based processing.

- System: The task is to create a simplified R&O representation of a specified piece of source code.
- Definitions:
    - Resource: Structures, entities, or data types within the code.
    - Operation: Significant actions, functions, or methods executed within the code.
- Guidelines for R&O Representation:
    - Resources Identification:
        - Library Imports: Primary libraries or modules being imported.
        - Input Filters: Input structures or filters.
        - Main Object: Principal object, struct, or class.
    - Operations Identification:
        - List associated operations under the main object, struct, or class.
        - Provide a brief description of the primary action being executed.
    - Structuring:
        - Use a hierarchical, indented format to depict dependencies or relationships clearly.
        - Ensure consistency for a standardized, concise output.
    - Conciseness and Abstraction:
        - Focus on high-level abstractions.
        - Avoid detailed syntax or token-level analysis.
